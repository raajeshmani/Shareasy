### A submission made in the hacker Earth for a hackathon


### Objective
		To ease the process of sharing links in a meetup, conference or in educational groups and then accessing that space whenever necessary. In short a one stop resource sharing medium for every groups without the requirement for entering user credentials. Its more of anyone can join if they know the coordinates which in this case can be a large string or even a lipsum generation.
		
### Implementation 
		For the environment - Create a flutter app which is cross platform.
		For the storage        - Use Firebase's Firestore - a realtime database
		For the ease of use   - Create touch to copy and paste Methodologies, to smoothen the feel.
		Enrinch User Experience - Create a QR Code with hashed key sequence and one tap to scan which directs to that space
		
### Applications:
	In conferences where people can stop to scan the qr code which automagically displays the agenda and schedule for the day along with the coordinates for that resource space.
	In classes where teachers can share the links in the space and that remains in that space forever (until Firebase's database gets rm -rf). 
	In social meetups where no user is required to login and to save the hassle of typing a long link. A scan which takes directly to that space will be a Godsend.
